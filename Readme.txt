Hello World! We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure 
domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to 
ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

In line with our nation's sacred document that is the United States Constitution, and the United States common law, I have 
established a project to adhere to the principles, morales, and standards set forth address the injustices faced daily by
United States citizens. For so long have we been seeing the proliferation of information technology. We have seen it 
proliferate into our everyday lives in every avenue, every corner, and every facet of American society. We now live in not
just a more interconnected nation, but a more interconnected world that has extended far beyond what our Founding Fathers
could have ever envisioned. We now engage others with this technology in both personal and professional means; establishing
and maintaining connections between family and friends, conducting business through trades, marketing, etc., and are able
to acquire information faster than ever before. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and with all good 
there is bound to come bad. We have seen bad actors who intend to harm others through various means. While there has been
success in stopping these bad actors, their methods have evolved over time and have, in turn, become more challenging to
stop. As people become more familiar with a technology over time, these same people have used this familiarity to continue
to harm others and countries that intened to harm us have become more sophisticated in their approach.

This project is intended to develop a system, infrastructure, etc., that applies the foundation provided through our
countries founding principles established by the law provided from our Founding Fathers, from what was learned
from ancient Greece circa the Golden Age of Athens as well as the Renaissance period, and modernizes it into a system
that applies through cyberspace.
